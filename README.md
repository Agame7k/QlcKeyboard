# QLC+ Web API

This project is a controller using the QLC+ Web API. The HTML file is sourced from [QLC+ Web API Test](https://www.qlcplus.org/Test_Web_API.html), and all code references this website.

This is configured specifically for my setup but it should be easy to configure easy for your setup

## Requirements

To run the Python script, you need the following libraries:

- `asyncio`: For asynchronous programming.
- `websockets`: For WebSocket communication.
- `pynput`: For keyboard input handling.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install asyncio websockets pynput
